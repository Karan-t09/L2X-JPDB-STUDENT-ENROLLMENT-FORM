Student Enrollment Form

This is a simple web-based form for enrolling students using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It uses the Login2Xplore JPDB JSON database for backend operations.

ðŸ”§ Features
- Save new student data
- Update existing data
- Reset form inputs
- Auto-fetch based on roll number

This is how the enrollment form looks on the web browser.

When we enter the first record then Database(SCHOOL-DB) and relation(STUDENT-TABLE) will be created automatically. This is the feature of JSONPowerDB. 
As per the requirements when Roll number is entered in form then â€˜saveâ€™ and â€˜resetâ€™ will be active.

This is the connection token received from JSONPowerDB.

We can see the record has been created with appropriate columns.

When in the form roll number is entered then search will be performed in the database for the roll number and all the data will be fetched. Hence the Roll number field working as Primary Key.

We can also update the record. Here I have changed the data.
